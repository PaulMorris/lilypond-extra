Let's make a list of tasks we want, then make sure that we're
doing them on sensible computers.

- Patchy staging-merge: powerful computer, no fixed internet
  connection.  Every 6 hours?
  % will be done on James' computer

- Patchy test-patches: powerful computer, fixed internet
  connection, lots of free space to host the regtest
  comparisons.  Every 2-4 hours?
  % currently on Grenouille, hopefully will change to be
  % done on James' computer and then uploaded to Grenouille
  % for serving with a fixed internet connection

- translation documentation building: relatively slow computer,
  fixed internet connection.  Every 24 hours?
  % currently on Grenouille

- building releases
  % currently on Phil's computer


Other possibilities include an extended regtest suite and/or
mutopia, and generating profiling data.
