There are a number of policy decisions -- some of them fairly
important -- which we have been postponing for a few years.  Now
that 2.14 is out, we will finally begin tackling them.

More background is here:
@uref{http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.15/Documentation/contributor/policy-decisions}

@subheading Meta-policies

To summarize and/or hopefully avoid useless fluffy discussions:

@itemize
@item
Topics will be introduced by Graham.  He will put an agenda for
the next month (or so) on @uref{http://lilypond.org/~graham/gop/}

@item
We will @strong{only} seriously discuss topics when we have
adequate background research.

@item
Emails about policy questions will begin with @code{GOP-PROP} in
the subject line.  Adjust your email filters accordingly,
depending on whether you are interested or not in such
discussions.

@item
There should be no surprises, no time pressure, etc.  If you are
particularly concerned about a decision but lack time/energy to
join the discussion, just say so and we will postponed the
decision.  I want to have clear, final, unambiguous decisions; if
that takes a long time, so be it.

@item
For each policy question, there will be at least @strong{one week}
for free-ranging discussion.  At that point, Graham will summarize
the discussion and announce a "probable decision".  We will then
have @strong{one more week} to let people point out flaws in the
summary, make additional arguments, etc.

@chapter GOP2-1 - LilyPond is part of GNU

@heading Summary

LilyPond has been a member of the GNU project for longer than I've
been involved (2001), but there's a few policies for which we
aren't in full compliance.  We should remedy this.

@heading Not optional

Some of these policies may raise questions from LilyPond
developers, but I'd like to eliminate certain questions or
debating positions right off the bat.  LilyPond is GNU software.
Meeting the requirements of GNU software is not optional (at
least, it @emph{should not} be optional).  I realize that we
haven't always done this, so I'm suggesting that we should only
enforce these after 2.16 is out.  But they definitely
@emph{should} be enforced.  We've benefitted from GNU hosting,
mailing lists, publicity, and GSoC umbrella organization-ness.

I am very option to suggestions that I (or Mike, who helped me
with this) misread or mis-summarized their policy document, or
suggestions that we can meet the obligations in other means.  But
I think we should start from the basis of @qq{is this an accurate
reflection of their policy document?} and @qq{what is the best way
to follow these requirements?}, not @qq{do we want to bother?}.

@example
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html}
@end example

In case somebody has the most extreme disagreement with GNU
policies, I will clarify that LilyPond is published under the
GPLv3 (and FDL 1.3+), which gives you the freedom to fork the
source code and run a separate project not affiliated with GNU,
provided that you abide by the copyright licenses.  Nothing in
this list impinges on your Freedom to do so -- in fact, one of the
underlying themes of these policies is to maximize people's
ability to do so.


I've separated the policies into project Requirements, project
Recommended, and maintainer Requirements.


@heading Project Requirements

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .1 .33

@headitem Requirement
  @tab Source
  @tab questions and implications for LilyPond

@item
All authors of more than 15 lines of code need to be listed
somewhere.
@tab
6.3
@tab
can we cover this requirement by pointing people at the git
history?  (answer: maybe for full source, but not for tarball)
@sp 1
Hopefully we can automate this process to some degree with git?

@item
Must have a copyright notice for all files longer than 10 lines,
including documentation, supporting files, images and sound files
(if the metadata allows this, or in a README or similarly-named
file in the same directory if not).  Using a minimal form (such as
in Emacs and Elisp manuals) is ok.  @qq{Recursive} permissions
(i.e.  @qq{everything in this directory tree} are not ok.
@sp 1
Copy ranges are only acceptable if every year is really a
@qq{copyrightable} year and if the README file details this usage.
Must use the @qq{or any later version} license.
@sp 1
Copyright headers for each file do not need to include everybody
who edited the file, only the main copyright holder(s).
@tab
6.5
@tab
This will take at least 10 hours to implement.

@item
All features must work on GNU/Linux; other operating systems are
optional
@tab
8
@tab
nothing stops us from also requiring features to work on other
operating systems, so Windows and OSX users don't need to panic.


@item
keep backups of source files, but git is sufficient for this
@tab
10
@tab


@item
on self-hosted websites, ensure that the site runs on Free
software alone.  (unreleased custom software is ok)
@tab
12.2
@tab
AFAIK lilypond.org is ok


@item
don't link to a website about lilypond, which the public
might perceive as connected with it and reflecting the position of
its developers, unless it also runs on free software.
(unreleased custom software is ok)
@tab
12.2
@tab


@item
avoid patented technologies as specified by GNU.  For example,
mp3.
@tab
13
@tab
There is no definitive list of such patent-crippled things, rather
this is a general reminder to avoid things which are known to be
crippled.

@item
do not recommend any non-Free programs, nor require a non-free
program to build
@tab
13
@tab
I'd better check the licenses of the @qq{Easier editing} programs.

@item
do not refer to any non-Free documentation for Free software
@tab
13
@tab
I think we're fine here

@item
do not use the term @qq{open source}, instead of @qq{Free
software}
@tab
14.1
@tab
German website main page not in compliance.

@item
do not write @qq{Linux}, instead write @qq{GNU/Linux} (unless we
are specifically talking about the kernel)
@tab
14.2
@tab
the download pages on the website need to be fixed.

@end multitable


@heading Project Recommended

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .1 .33

@headitem Requirement
  @tab Source
  @tab notes and questions

@item
assign copyright to FSF (this adds a bunch of obligations not
listed in this document)
@tab
6.1
@tab
we're not going to do this.

@item
Thank everybody who reports a bug, but no requirement to help
users directly instead of improving code
@tab
9.3
@tab
I think the Bug Squad already does this, but maybe add it to the
Bug Squad checklist?  :)
@sp 1
Also, remind the two grumpy developers that they shouldn't reply
to bug reports unless they feel amazingly un-grumpy that day.

@item
use ftp.gnu.org for official source releases
@tab
11.3
@tab
would require 10 hours of work; not worth it IMO

@item
announce stable releases on info-gnu@
@tab
11.6
@tab
do-able if somebody makes a list of places to announce new stable
releases.
@uref{http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/detail?id=1719}

@item
post release announcements on the savannah project site
@tab
@tab
would take 5-10 hours to set up

@item
web pages should include manuals in
HTML, DVI, Info, PostScript,
PDF, plain ASCII, and Texinfo format (source)
@tab
12.3
@tab
Ouch.  dvi, postscript, and plain ASCII?

@item
make a diff between releases
@tab
11.2
@tab
let's not bother; interested parties can make a diff themselves
from git.

@item
manuals should be listed at @uref{http://www.gnu.org/manual} as
well as our own website
@tab
12.3
@tab
points to old website docs; I need to find out how to update this
link.

@item
if feasible, use Guile for extensions, although @qq{For some
programs there's a reason to do things differently, but please use
GUILE if that is feasible.}
@tab
(email to new maintainers, not in the guide yet)
@tab

@heading Maintainer required

These apply to the GNU maintainer(s) personally, not for normal
project members.

Role of GNU maintainer (section 5):

@quotation
... you cannot expect all contributors to support the GNU Project,
or to have a concern for its policies and standards. So part of
your job as maintainer is to exercise your authority on these
points when they arise. No matter how much of the work other
people do, you are in charge of what goes in the release. When a
crucial point arises, you should calmly state your decision and
stick to it.
