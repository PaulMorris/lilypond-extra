There are a number of policy decisions -- some of them fairly
important -- which we have been postponing for a few years.  Now
that 2.14 is out, we will finally begin tackling them.

More background is here:
@uref{http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.15/Documentation/contributor/policy-decisions}

@subheading Meta-policies

To summarize and/or hopefully avoid useless fluffy discussions:

@itemize
@item
Topics will be introduced by Graham.  He will put an agenda for
the next month (or so) on @uref{http://lilypond.org/~graham/gop/}

@item
We will @strong{only} seriously discuss topics when we have
adequate background research.

@item
Emails about policy questions will begin with @code{GOP-PROP} in
the subject line.  Adjust your email filters accordingly,
depending on whether you are interested or not in such
discussions.

@item
There should be no surprises, no time pressure, etc.  If you are
particularly concerned about a decision but lack time/energy to
join the discussion, just say so and we will postponed the
decision.  I want to have clear, final, unambiguous decisions; if
that takes a long time, so be it.

@item
For each policy question, there will be at least @strong{one week}
for free-ranging discussion.  At that point, Graham will summarize
the discussion and announce a "probable decision".  We will then
have @strong{one more week} to let people point out flaws in the
summary, make additional arguments, etc.

I've separated these into project Requirements, project
Recommended, and maintainer Requirements.


@heading Project Requirements

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .1 .33

@headitem Requirement
  @tab Source
  @tab notes and questions

@item
All authors of more than 15 lines of code need to be listed
somewhere.
@tab
6.2
@tab
is this a requirement for all projects, or just
FSF-copyright-assigned projects?  It isn't clear from the context.
@sp 1
can we cover this requirement by
pointing people at the git history?
@c Not in compliance; hopefully we can automate this process to
@c some degree with git?

@item
Must have a copyright notice for all files longer than 10 lines,
including documentation, supporting files, images and sound files
(if the metadata allows this or in a README file in the same
directory if not).  Copy ranges are only acceptable in special
circumstances which aren't worth bothering with.  Must use the
@qq{or any later version} license.
@tab
6.5
@tab
@c ouch, this will be a lot of work.
@c @sp 1
Must the file be called README, or could it be LICENSE?  Also, can
we have a top-level LICENSE.DOCUMENTATION which gives a general
@qq{everything under Documentation/ is GPL FDLv1.3+ <insert longer
text>, with the following exceptions}.

@item
Copyright headers for each file do not need to include everybody
who edited the file, only the main copyright holder(s).
@tab
6.5
@tab
@c (text notes that recording everybody who edited the file @qq{would
@c be rather inconvenient}, so I'm hoping that we can find a
@c not-terribly-invenient solution for the copyright notices.

@item
All features must work on GNU/Linux; other operating systems are
optional
@tab
8
@tab


@item
keep backups of source files, but git is sufficient for this
@tab
10
@tab


@item
on self-hosted websites, ensure that the site runs on Free
software alone.  (unreleased custom software is ok)
@tab
12.2
@tab


@item
don't link to a website about lilypond, which the public
might perceive as connected with it and reflecting the position of
its developers, unless it also runs on free software.
@tab
12.2
@tab


@item
avoid patented technologies as specified by GNU.  For example,
mp3.
@tab
13
@tab
Is there a definitive place to find the list of the relevant
@qq{particular patented technology} ?  I don't want to have to go
trawling through FSF blogs to find out what we're supposed to
avoid.

@item
do not recommend any non-Free programs, nor require a non-free
program to build
@tab
13
@tab

@item
do not refer to any non-Free documentation for Free software
@tab
13
@tab

@item
do not use the term @qq{open source}, instead of @qq{Free
software}
@tab
14.1
@tab

@item
do not write @qq{Linux}, instead write @qq{GNU/Linux} (unless we
are specifically talking about the kernel)
@tab
14.2
@tab

@heading Project Recommended

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .1 .33

@headitem Requirement
  @tab Source
  @tab notes and questions

@item
assign copyright to FSF (this adds a bunch of obligations not
listed in this document)
@tab
6.1
@tab

@item
Keep a record of who did what in AUTHORS
@tab
6.3
@tab
Is this actually required?  doesn't the git history handle this?
it'll be a huge administration drain otherwise.
@sp 1
LilyPond's current policy is this:
@uref{http://lilypond.org/authors.html} (also distributed in
text), which gives a short blurb for people with git push ability,
and simply lists of general contribution area for non-git-push
contributors.

@item
Thank everybody who reports a bug, but no requirement to help
users directly instead of improving code
@tab
9.3
@tab

@item
use ftp.gnu.org for official source releases
@tab
11.3
@tab
@c would require 10 hours of work

@item
announce stable releases on info-gnu@
@tab
11.6
@tab

@item
post release announcements on the savannah project site
@tab
@tab
@c would take 5-10 hours to set up

@item
web pages should include manuals in
HTML, DVI, Info, PostScript,
PDF, plain ASCII, and Texinfo format (source)
@tab
12.3
@tab

@item
make a diff between releases
@tab
11.2
@tab

@item
manuals should be listed at @uref{http://www.gnu.org/manual} as
well as our own website
@tab
12.3
@tab

@heading Maintainer required

These apply to the GNU maintainer(s) personally, not for normal
project members.

Role of GNU maintainer (section 5):

@quotation
... you cannot expect all contributors to support the GNU Project,
or to have a concern for its policies and standards. So part of
your job as maintainer is to exercise your authority on these
points when they arise. No matter how much of the work other
people do, you are in charge of what goes in the release. When a
crucial point arises, you should calmly state your decision and
stick to it.
